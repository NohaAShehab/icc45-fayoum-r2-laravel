when need to perform any crud operation on  a resouce

-->best practice to use request methods
    product ->>
    -> Get   /product ===> get all products
    -> post  /product  ==>post new product  --> insert
    -> get  /product/id  ==> get one product
    -> put  /product/id ==> update product
    -> delete /product/id ===> delete product

    -> get /product/create ==> display form to create product
    -> get /product/edit ==> display form to edit products










# slug  --> used in the urls --> instead of using ids ??

# slug  --> based on  field --> --> unique  --> composed of field

product --> apple laptop
=> slug apple-laptop

--->>slug ==> getting object
